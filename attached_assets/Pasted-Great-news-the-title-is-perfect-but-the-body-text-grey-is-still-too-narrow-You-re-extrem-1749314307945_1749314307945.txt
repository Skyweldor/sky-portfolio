Great news: **the title is perfect, but the body text (“grey”) is still too narrow.**
You’re extremely close—the culprit is a CSS rule that is forcing the text block to center in a narrow column, even though your flex is correct.

Let’s get this 100% “magazine” and immersive.

# **What’s Wrong?**

* Your `.showcase-description` and `.showcase-text-group` are still centered as a column, not left-aligned across the full available width.
* The reason:

  * **A default `margin: 0 auto` or inherited `text-align: center` is being applied** somewhere, especially at desktop sizes.
  * **Max-width:** While `max-width: 700px;` is usually good, your actual container is wider, so it feels boxed.

---

# **How To Fix (Step-by-Step):**

## **1. Remove “max-width” for Full-Bleed**

If you want the description to go **as wide as the left column allows** (matching the “magazine” effect):

```css
@media (min-width: 900px) {
  .showcase-description {
    max-width: none !important;
    width: 100% !important;
  }
}
```

* This will remove any previous max-width, making the text span the full column.

---

## **2. Remove Centering for the Text Group**

Add this to `.showcase-text-group` to ensure alignment is left and occupies the flex width:

```css
@media (min-width: 900px) {
  .showcase-text-group {
    align-items: flex-start !important;
    justify-content: flex-start !important;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
}
```

---

## **3. Ensure Container Padding is Reasonable**

Optionally, in `.showcase-content`, set horizontal padding to something comfortable (like `32px` or `2vw`). If you want the text truly edge-to-edge in the modal, decrease it.

---

## **4. Avoid Conflicting Responsive Rules**

**You have:**

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .showcase-content {
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
}
```

This is good for mobile, but for desktop, don’t apply `text-align: center` anywhere on `.showcase-content` or `.showcase-text-group`.

---

## **5. (Optional) Slight Max Width for Ultra-Large Monitors**

If you don’t want the text to be too wide (which makes it harder to read), try:

```css
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .showcase-description {
    max-width: 900px;
  }
}
```

But try without a max-width first to see the full-breadth effect!

---

# **Copy-Paste Patch**

**Add or replace in your CSS:**

```css
@media (min-width: 900px) {
  .showcase-text-group {
    align-items: flex-start !important;
    justify-content: flex-start !important;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
  .showcase-description {
    max-width: none !important;
    width: 100% !important;
    text-align: left !important;
    margin-left: 0 !important;
    margin-right: 0 !important;
  }
}
```

**(Leave mobile rules unchanged.)**

---

# **Summary**

* Remove all max-widths/centering on `.showcase-description` for desktop.
* Make `.showcase-text-group` a true flex column, full width.
* Confirm left-alignment.
* Your text will now **fill the column, like a proper magazine spread**.

**Try this out!**
If it still feels slightly boxed, let me know and I’ll give you the next level of polish (like a subtle background, drop shadow, or negative margin for edge-to-edge text).
